Hopin tech dry run: May 24
Presentation day: May 25
Demo day: May 26

STRICT LENGTH : 5 MINS
- Private session breakout rooms afterwards 

Scoping out the Project::
What is the dataset? Is there one available?
- hockey-reference.com
What are the inputs/outputs of the model? (as numbers)
What do you want to do with your model? 
- forecast next season's stats
Is machine learning necessary? 
- idk but it's gotta be time series


Additional Considerations: 
- Unless you want a big challenge, avoid learning something
new (reinforcement learning, GANs)
- Is there prior work that can help you out? 
- Is it computationally expensive? 

If your accuracy is lower, explain why:
if you're doing something different than someone else, 
explain why: 
- is it better / more efficient your way? 
- is it less computationally expensive? 


Iterative progress and difficulty
- make a minimum viable product ***EARLY!!!***
- 


MILESTONES
Each item must be SPECIFIC and DATED
1. Research prior work 
2. Acquire / preprocess / explore dataset 
3. Design model
4. Train and evaluate model 
5. Perform experiments (if any) 
6. Deploy model (or make figures)
7. Finish presentation 



Deployment and Demo options 
- You don't need to deploy or demo anything (good figures
can work just as well)
- Consider whether the demo is too long or risky 
- Deployment options: 
Flask API (might demo with Postman)
Flask app with UI (hard, need to write HTML)
AWS remote Flask app (faster machine, $$)
Mobile app (hardest)
streamlit.io (good if you want UI, but learning a new library)


Code
- Define functions whenever possible (ex: clean_data(df))
- Use pipelines for joint preprocessing, feature engineering, 
and model
- If using deep learning, generate training/validation curves 
as a function of epoch to see if your model is improving 
- Save trained models and only retrain when needed
- Consider using ordinary .py files (like notebooks) so 
that you can split the project up into multiple files 
(data_cleaning.py, training.py, app.py)
- DON'T SHOW ANY CODE IN THE PRESENTATION 


Presentation: 
- you're showing off to employers 
- you explain the scope of the problem, and how you would 
solve it for them
